name: figma-build
description: Build a Figma design from code or a description — the reverse of figma-codegen. Reuses the connected file's existing design system (components, variables, styles) instead of drawing primitives with hardcoded values. Triggers whenever the user wants something created or updated IN Figma from code or a spec — e.g. 'build this in Figma', 'create a Figma design for this', 'push this component/screen to Figma', 'turn this React/Vue into a Figma design', 'recreate this UI in Figma', 'make a Figma version of …', 'design a landing page/screen in Figma' — or whenever a coding artifact (a component, page, or spec) appears alongside a request to author in a connected Figma file. Works for full screens, sections, single components, or design-system assets.

# figma-build

Turn code or a description into a Figma design that looks like it belongs in the file: **reuse the
components, variables, and styles that already exist, and only build what's genuinely missing.** This
is the mirror image of `figma-codegen` — same "reuse beats regenerate / reference tokens not
literals" philosophy, pointed at the canvas instead of the codebase. This file is the router; deep
detail lives in [`references/`](./references) — load a reference when its step is in play.

You operate on the **connected** Figma file (the plugin's current session). There is no fetch-by-URL;
the user must have the target file open. Confirm a plugin is connected (`ping`) before building.

## When to use

- The user wants to **create or update** something in Figma from code or a description — a screen,
  view, modal/dialog/drawer/sidebar/panel, a single component, or a design-system asset.
- **Not** for reading a Figma design into code — that's `figma-codegen`.

## More than one Figma file open

Every tool result says so when it applies, so you do not have to check up front: with two or more
files connected and none claimed, results carry a `MORE THAN ONE FIGMA FILE IS OPEN` block naming
them. It matters because calls otherwise follow whichever file the user last touched, which changes
when they switch tabs — so a task can read one file and write to another and report success.

When you see it, claim the file before doing anything else: `list_files` names every connected file,
`use_file({ fileName })` claims one for this session (`use_file({ sessionId })` when two open files
share a name — Figma allows that, and `x (Copy)` is how it happens). Every later call then reaches
that file whatever is in front, including while its tab sits in the background. If the user has not
said which file, ask — do not guess from the names.

## First, understand the environment, then build (provider-first)

The write-side mirror of codegen's grounding, and the **most important habit**: an off-looking build
almost always comes from **invented values** or **assumed conventions**. So **understand this user's
actual environment first, then build into it** — never apply a generic template. There's no single
"right" stack; there's _their_ stack. Look at **both ends** before creating anything:

- **The Figma file** — its existing design system, which you'll reuse and bind to:
  1. **`get_variable_defs`** → the file's variables (colour / spacing / radius / typography) with
     names + values + `hex`. These are the tokens you bind to.
  2. **`scan_components`** / **`get_local_components`** → existing components to **instance** rather
     than rebuild. Match the source UI pattern (a card, a list row, a nav, a button) to a component.
  3. **`get_styles`** → shared paint / text / effect styles to apply.
- **The source you were handed** — when it's code, _which_ stack and styling system (Tailwind /
  Chakra / MUI / CSS modules / vanilla …) and whether it has a config / theme / tokens file. That's
  where its real values live — read them from there, don't assume a default.

Then build, tracing every value to a source in priority order: **reuse** an existing
component / variable / style; else take the **exact value from the source's own code** —
provider-first, resolving whatever styling system it uses to real px / hex (CSS literally;
Tailwind / Chakra / UnoCSS / … via their config or scale), never eyeballed; only **invent** from a
consistent scale when neither exists. Full detail + the value-resolution method in
`references/write-rules.md`.

## Two jobs — both follow the write rules

Every build obeys the same cross-cutting rules — ground values (design system → source code → scale),
reference tokens (colour via `bind_variable_to_paint`, scalars via `bind_variable_to_node`, shared
looks via `apply_style_to_node`), auto-layout for related children (absolute only for top-level
placement), HUG/FILL/FIXED sizing via `set_layout_props` (so the layout computes sizes — don't
hardcode width/height), and real fonts (a new TEXT node defaults to Inter). →
**[`references/write-rules.md`](./references/write-rules.md).**

- **Assemble a screen / component from what exists** (the common case): recognise the UI pattern,
  `create_instance` matching components, bind tokens, build incrementally, screenshot-verify each
  step. → **[`references/assemble-screens.md`](./references/assemble-screens.md).**
- **Author a new design-system asset** (only when grounding found no equivalent): create
  variables/collections, paint/text styles, or components + variant sets, then switch back to the
  reuse path. → **[`references/author-design-system.md`](./references/author-design-system.md).**

## Motion (animation)

When the source carries animation — CSS `@keyframes` / `transition`, Framer Motion, GSAP, a Vue/Svelte
transition — author it as Figma **Motion (beta)** on the frame you built rather than dropping it:
`apply_animation_style` (presets from `get_motion_styles`) or `apply_manual_keyframe_track` per
property, `set_timeline_duration` for length. A staggered row is **one atomic `batch`** of
`apply_animation_style` ops with increasing `config.timelineOffset` — not N calls. Motion is
Figma-Design-only and keyframes attach to a top-level frame's layers, so build the frame first.
→ **[`references/motion.md`](./references/motion.md).**

## Verify visually (close the loop)

`get_screenshot` the built node, fix discrepancies, and re-screenshot — the same render-and-diff
discipline codegen uses, in reverse. Check it against the source intent **and** against objective
design health (this catches problems even when you built from a vague description with no source to
compare): nothing clipped or overflowing, edges aligned, spacing consistent (one scale), a clear type
hierarchy. An `empty: true` export means the node rendered nothing (hidden / off-canvas).

## Rules

- **Understand the environment, then build.** Read both the file's design system _and_ the source's
  stack / styling system before creating anything — there's no single right stack, only _theirs_.
  Ground every value (design system → the code's own values → a sensible scale); never invent.
- **Reuse beats regenerate.** Instance existing components; bind existing variables/styles. Build new
  only what the system lacks, and name/structure it to fit.
- **Reference tokens, not literals.** Colour via `bind_variable_to_paint`, scalars via
  `bind_variable_to_node`, shared looks via `apply_style_to_node` — never hardcode hex/px when a
  token exists (`get_variable_defs` tells you what does).
- **Auto-layout for related children**, absolute coordinates only for top-level placement.
- **Build incrementally and validate** (screenshot) — recognise the UI pattern and assemble it from
  the matching components, don't reproduce it from primitives.
- **Match the file's conventions** — naming, structure, and the design system's own patterns, the
  way codegen mirrors the project's existing code style.
