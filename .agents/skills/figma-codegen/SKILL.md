name: figma-codegen
description: Generate framework-aware code from a Figma design. Reads the project's stack profile and emits code matching the existing framework (React/Vue/Svelte/Next/etc.) and styling (Tailwind/CSS/CSS-in-JS), reusing existing components and design tokens instead of regenerating from scratch. Triggers whenever the user wants a Figma design turned into code — e.g. 'code this design', 'implement this frame', 'build this screen/component', 'turn this Figma into React/Vue', 'convert this design to code' — or whenever a Figma URL or the current Figma selection appears alongside a coding request. Works for full screens, single sections, or one component.

# figma-codegen

Turn a Figma selection into code that looks like the rest of the project: reuse the components and
tokens that already exist, only build what's genuinely missing. The grounded tools do the heavy
lifting so you are not guessing from a screenshot. This file is the router; deep detail lives in
[`references/`](./references) — load a reference when its step is in play.

## When to use

- The user pastes a Figma URL/selection and asks for code ("code this", "build this component").
- The user wants to extend an existing component to match a Figma frame.

## More than one Figma file open

Every tool result says so when it applies, so you do not have to check up front: with two or more
files connected and none claimed, results carry a `MORE THAN ONE FIGMA FILE IS OPEN` block naming
them. It matters because calls otherwise follow whichever file the user last touched, which changes
when they switch tabs — so a task can read one file and write to another and report success.

When you see it, claim the file before doing anything else: `list_files` names every connected file,
`use_file({ fileName })` claims one for this session (`use_file({ sessionId })` when two open files
share a name — Figma allows that, and `x (Copy)` is how it happens). Every later call then reaches
that file whatever is in front, including while its tab sits in the background. If the user has not
said which file, ask — do not guess from the names.

## Workflow

Run the grounded tools against the selection, then generate — **trust them over the rendered image.**

1. **`get_design_context`** (detail `full`, `dedupeComponents: true`) → the structural tree with
   tokens resolved to names (`Primary/500`, `spacing/4`), styles deduped into `globalVars`, and each
   instance's `mainComponent` / `componentProperties`. This is the layout + binding source of truth.
   Keep `dedupeComponents: true` and don't depth-limit a subtree you'll build from.
   → **How to read the tree, the per-node fidelity catalog (effects, per-side borders, stroke align,
   per-corner radius, blend, masks, gradients, image-fit, auto-layout/grid, aspect-ratio,
   scroll/sticky, stack & stroke-space), Dev Mode annotations as ground truth, and grounding a page
   too big for one call: [`references/grounding.md`](./references/grounding.md).**

2. **`component_map`** → every Figma component grouped to a local code component with a `status`
   (high / medium / low / unmapped), `candidate.filePath`, and `matchedProps`.
   - `high` / `medium`: **reuse that component** (import from `candidate.filePath`), don't regenerate.
     Never invent a component name `component_map` didn't report.
   - `candidate.ambiguousWith` (a capped list of `{ name, filePath }`): the Figma name matched two or
     more code components nearly equally and the join couldn't confidently pick — a **verify-me** pick,
     not a confident reuse (the analogue of `token_map`'s `ambiguousWith`). Check which of the winning
     `candidate` + these runner-ups is the right component for _this_ context before importing (a wrong
     reuse is a silent visual bug), then record the confirmed one in the map file so the next run is
     certain. Absent when the pick was unambiguous.
   - Wire each entry's `instances[].props` (resolved variant / boolean / text values) onto the reused
     component — one element per instance, with its own props.
   - `candidate.unmatchedProps`: Figma axes the component has no prop for (a leading icon, a `required`
     flag, an active state) → surface as component-extension TODOs, never fake them with ad-hoc markup.
   - `unmapped`: build it new in the project's style. For a **repeated** unmapped component
     (`instanceCount > 1`), build from its **first instance's** subtree; if that came back
     `deduped`/`truncated`, drill `get_design_context` on `instances[0].nodeId` once — don't rebuild a
     repeated component by eye.
   - When you're emitting a component's **own definition** (its prop types, not just rendering it),
     `get_component_api` on the component/instance returns the full property API — every VARIANT option
     and each BOOLEAN/TEXT/INSTANCE_SWAP prop with its default — so the prop space is grounded, not
     inferred from the instances you happened to see.

3. **`token_map`** → every Figma variable joined to a project token with `status` + `ref` + `matchedBy`.
   A document's shared paint styles (single solid color styles — the token mechanism of
   pre-variables files) join the same way, marked `source: 'style'`.
   - mapped: reference `candidate.ref` (`bg-primary-500`, `var(--color-primary-500)`) — never the raw
     hex/px `get_design_context` resolved. `matchedBy: ['name']` on a colour (value drifted): use it
     but flag the mismatch.
   - `candidate.ambiguousWith` (several project tokens share that exact value and the name couldn't
     split them): a capped, verify-me pick — choose the semantically right sibling for the context
     (or keep the value and flag the gap), never treat it as a confirmed reuse.
   - On a document with few or no variables (most real-world files), `get_design_context`'s own
     `projectTokens` map is the fallback: any raw color in the payload that exactly equals a project
     token's value is annotated there (`{ "#6266F0": { ref, name, matchedBy: ["value"] } }`). Before
     hardcoding a hex, look it up and emit the `ref` when it fits the context semantically.
     `matchedBy: ["value"]` marks the entry as name-blind value-equality evidence — a hypothesis to
     verify, not a resolved binding: an entry with `candidates` lists same-value tokens to choose
     between by meaning, a semantically wrong token is **worse** than the raw value (keep the raw
     value and note the gap instead), and a bound Figma variable always outranks a raw-value match.
   - `framework-builtin` (a built-in scale step of the project's utility framework — Tailwind or
     UnoCSS — e.g. `spacing/4`, `line-height/7`, `weight/Bold`): carries `builtin: { scale, step }`
     — compose the utility (`p-4`/`gap-4`, `leading-7`, `font-bold`), **not** an arbitrary
     `p-[16px]`. This is **not** a gap.
   - `from` (a SCSS variable): the ref does **not** resolve on its own. The file you write must
     import the declaring file, and `from` is **repo-relative** while Sass resolves `@use` against
     the _importing_ file — so re-resolve it from where you are writing: from
     `src/components/card.scss`, `from: src/styles/_tokens.scss` becomes
     `@use '../styles/tokens' as *`, never the repo-relative path verbatim. `as *` keeps the ref as
     given; the project's own `@use` style may namespace it instead (`@use '../styles/tokens'` makes
     `$color-primary-500` into `tokens.$color-primary-500`). Emitting the ref without the import is
     a **compile error**, not a style nit.
   - `unmapped`: use the value but call out the gap (offer to add it to the token source); don't
     hardcode silently.
   - `figmaModes` (`{ Light: …, Dark: … }`, with the file's theme axes on `themedCollections`): the
     token is **theme-dependent** — `figmaValue` is only the default mode, never the whole story.
     Mapped: emit `candidate.ref` and confirm the project token itself switches per theme (`.dark` /
     `[data-theme]` / `prefers-color-scheme` / a `dark:` story); if the project defines only one
     value, wire the other mode's value into that mechanism or surface a theme gap. Unmapped: the
     default mode is the base, other modes ride the project's dark-mode mechanism (`dark:` variants /
     `prefers-color-scheme`). Themes encoded without native modes — paired collections or name
     groups (`Color/Light/*` + `Color/Dark/*`, a plan-limited workaround) — get the same treatment.

4. **Export the assets grounding can't carry** — logos, photos, icons have no pixels and otherwise
   render as grey blocks. `save_image_fills` for `IMAGE`-fill nodes (the original asset, not a
   clipped re-render), `icon_map` first for icons (reuse curated `.svg`s), `get_screenshot` only for
   the composited look.
   → **Full asset/icon/svg/colour-contract workflow:
   [`references/assets-and-icons.md`](./references/assets-and-icons.md).**

Then emit code in the detected stack (the profile comes back on `component_map` / `token_map`; you do
not call `analyze_project` yourself): compose the reused components, wrap unmapped pieces, and apply
token references for colour/spacing/radius/typography.

## Keep code in sync as the design changes

Codegen is rarely one-shot — the design keeps moving. To make the second pass an incremental edit
instead of a regeneration:

- **After you generate**, `design_diff` on the section/component `nodeId` saves a baseline (its
  `get_design_context`) under `.figwright/snapshots/`. Committing that file lets teammates share the
  baseline; the tool never touches git.
- **When asked to re-sync** ("the design changed, update the component"), `design_diff` the same
  `nodeId` again: it returns the per-node, per-property delta — `added` / `removed` / `changed` nodes
  with resolved values (a fill, a padding, a text string, a token rebind), each with a readable `path`
  (`Card / Header / Title`). Edit only the code those nodes map to; don't regenerate the screen.
  Ground each changed value the usual way (it's a `get_design_context` slice), then `design_diff` with
  `update: true` to accept the new design as the baseline.
- Scope it by the same `nodeId` unit you coded from. `no-changes` means the design is untouched since
  the baseline — nothing to do.

## Record verified mappings (so the next run reuses, not re-guesses)

The joins re-derive from scratch every run. A mapping you **confirmed** — reused a component and it
rendered right, resolved an ambiguous colour to the semantically correct token — is worth recording
so the next run treats it as ground truth instead of re-guessing. Two append-only map files, each read
back by its join as highest authority:

- **`docs/figma-component-map.md`** — rows `| FigmaName | code/path |` (or `FigmaName -> path`).
  `component_map` then returns that component as `source: 'map-file'`, confidence 1.
- **`docs/figma-token-map.md`** — rows `| FigmaName | ref |`. `token_map` returns it as
  `matchedBy: ['map-file']`, confidence 1. The `ref` is what you'd emit — a utility (`bg-primary-500`),
  a `var(--color-primary-500)`, or the bare token name.

- **A recorded row OVERRIDES the fuzzy join on every future run — so record proof, not a pick.** The
  gate is your own verify step (§ Responsive & verify): only after you rendered the result and it
  matched the Figma node do you record the mapping you _proved_. A wrong row doesn't fail loudly — it
  silently mis-maps that component/token in every future generation until a human notices, which is
  worse than no record at all. If you're not certain, don't record it; a re-guess next run is
  recoverable, a confidently-wrong recorded row is not.
- **Record only the mappings the join was unsure of** — a `low`/`medium` component match you
  confirmed, an `unmapped` component you built (record its new file), or a token that came back
  `ambiguousWith` / `matchedBy: ['value']` / `unmapped` and you resolved by meaning. Skip the
  already-`high` deterministic matches; they re-derive correctly and a row for them is just noise.
- **These files are committed project docs — treat a row like a line of code you're asserting is
  correct**, not a scratch note. One figma name → one target per row; keep them reviewable.
- **Keep the files healthy.** When `component_map` / `token_map` report `staleOverrides` (a recorded
  target that no longer resolves — the file/token was renamed or deleted), the join has already
  degraded to the fuzzy result; fix that row to the new target or delete it.

## Responsive & verify

- **Responsive by default** — root is `w-full`, never the artboard's fixed width; ground breakpoints
  from the file's other-width frames. → [`references/responsive.md`](./references/responsive.md).
- **Verify visually before you call it done** — render with the project's toolchain, screenshot at the
  design's viewport, diff against the Figma node, fix at the source.
  → [`references/verify.md`](./references/verify.md).

## Motion (animation)

When `get_design_context` (full detail) tags a node with a `motion` summary — applied
animation-style presets, animated property fields, a timeline duration — carry it into the project's
animation mechanism (CSS `@keyframes` / `transition`, Framer Motion, GSAP, Vue `<transition>`) instead
of emitting a static component. `get_node_motion` returns the full keyframe detail when the summary
isn't enough. Dropping a frame's animation is a fidelity miss, the same class as dropping a shadow.
→ [`references/motion.md`](./references/motion.md).

## Rules

- **Ground every section — never eyeball a value off the screenshot.** Every px size, colour,
  font-size, radius, and spacing comes from `get_design_context`, for _every_ section. The screenshot
  is visual intent only; guessing "the easy sections" is the cardinal miss. On a page too big to ground
  at once, scope by section `nodeId` — never depth-cap the whole page, never retry an oversized call.
- **Reuse beats regenerate.** A `high`/`medium` `component_map` candidate must be imported and used.
- **Reference tokens, not literals.** Emit a mapped variable's `ref`; reserve raw values for `unmapped`
  gaps, and surface those gaps rather than burying them.
- **Carry every visual property, don't drop fidelity.** Effects, per-side borders + `strokeAlign`,
  per-corner radius, blend mode, masks, gradients, image `scaleMode`, and auto-layout/grid spacing are
  all in the context — translate each (the catalog is in `references/grounding.md`). Dropping any is a
  grounding miss, not a simplification.
- **Export visual assets, don't fake them.** A grey box or a hand-typed wordmark is a miss.
- **Match the project, not a house style.** Mirror the existing import style, file layout, and naming.
- **Spell class names in full; don't assemble them from `&`.** In a language whose `&` concatenates
  (SCSS / Sass / Less / Stylus / postcss-nested) `.card { &__title {} }` compiles to
  `.card__title` — a name that exists only after
  compilation, so the class the markup carries appears nowhere in the source and adjusting one rule
  means searching a fragment like `__title` and reading every hit. Declare it flat at the top level
  instead. `profile.styling.classNaming` (on `component_map` / `token_map`) reports the project's own
  habit and **the project wins**: `ampersand` → write `&__title`; `flat` or absent → write flat.
  → [`references/stylesheets.md`](./references/stylesheets.md) for the descendant-selector trap that
  looks like the fix and isn't, and what `&` is still the right tool for.
- **Render and verify before you call it done.** (See `references/verify.md`.)
- Never write a config file or wizard prompt; everything is inferred from the project + the tools.
